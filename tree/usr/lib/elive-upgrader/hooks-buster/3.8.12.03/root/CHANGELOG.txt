SSD SPEED IMPROVEMENTS:  Did you felt any slowness recently in Elive? (like in the browser, or even using VIM), that's because the new improved and smart I/O schedulers overthinks too much and doesn't works so well (mq-deadline I/O sched), making your hard disk delayed on sync's without show much improvements. Elive don't blindly follow rules and decided to select the "none" scheduler after 2 days of benchmarkings, most of the times "simple is better", this selected scheduler is simply more responsive, fast, INSTANT!... just like Elive should be, every delay or slowness in Elive is unnaceptable, we will burn them in fire and kick them out from our lifes :) - reboot and enjoy faster speeds in your Elive -
