IMPERMUTABILITY Feature added:  This is an amazing feature designed more than 15 years ago for Elive and NOW IS READY! Basically you will have now an extra boot entry which allows you to boot your Elive system in a statically-locked filesystem, this means that you can do whatever you want in the system and it will be deleted in your next reboot, this allows you to make tests, installing untrustable software, or doing a massive installing of packages to simply betatest and have it everything clean again after that. Enjoy!
