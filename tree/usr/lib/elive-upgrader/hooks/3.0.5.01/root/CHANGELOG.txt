Mechanical disks are prone to fail, and we normally don't notice this until it is too late, this is not going to be a problem anymore in Elive, in every login you will be reported if a new Hard disk issue has been found or changed, there's 3 types of notification reports, see more information about this feature and some screenshots in the Elive Forums (Accouncements -> Features section). Enjoy!
